You should read that page, but some other diagnostics for R code include:

1.  Check for Missing, unmatched, partially matched, and too many arguments to functions
1.  Warn if a variable is not defined
1.  Warn if a variable is defined but not used
1.  Style diagnostics to ensure the code conforms to the [tidyverse style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).
